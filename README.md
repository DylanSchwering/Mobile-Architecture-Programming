Event Inventory is an offline event tracker with on‑device login and optional SMS reminders, built so organizers never miss deadlines. It features four core screens;login/signup, the main event grid, an add/edit form, and an SMS‑permission prompt; all designed with minimal, high‑contrast layouts, large tap targets, and clear labels for first‑time ease. Architecturally, the app separates concerns through a DatabaseHelper for SQLite, an Event model class, and focused activities, with dynamic row inflation keeping the code both tidy and efficient. Rigorous emulator testing of sign‑up, CRUD operations, and SMS‑grant/deny flows uncovered edge cases and ensured graceful degradation. The innovative use of table‑row inflation optimized performance and maintainability, and the real‑time CRUD grid showcases seamless Android layout handling and robust data persistence.
